# üé§ Speech Emotion Detection (Real-time using Machine Learning)

This is a collaborative project that focuses on detecting emotions from **human speech in real time** using classical Machine Learning techniques. It includes everything from data preprocessing and model training to a live audio interface using Flask.

> üîç **Goal:** Given a voice recording, detect the speaker's emotion such as *happy, sad, angry, calm, etc.*

## üìå What this project does

1. Takes voice input from a **microphone or uploaded audio file** (`.wav`)
2. Extracts audio features like:
   - **MFCCs**
   - **Chroma**
   - **Spectral Contrast**
   - **Mel Spectrogram**
   - **Tonnetz**
   - **RMS Energy**
   - **Zero Crossing Rate**
3. Uses **feature selection (SelectKBest)** and **data scaling**
4. Trains a **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLPClassifier)** on balanced data (using **SMOTE**)
5. Predicts the emotion using the trained model
6. Displays emotion on a real-time **Flask web interface**
